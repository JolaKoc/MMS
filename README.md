Medical Management System

Taking into consideration the numerous problems in our country’s health department such as medical records being on paper and people waiting in long lines, we came up with the idea of creating a Web-based Application to digitalize the way the public hospitals in our country work. 

Our project will be based on these main points:

    •	Leaving appointments online
  
    •	Keeping medical records of each patient in digital form
    
    •	Keeping records of emergency entries and hospitalizations
    
    •	Showing medical personnel timetables

  
The implementation of the idea will work closely with polyclinics by having access at their databases for patients they forward to our system. Polyclinic’s receptionists, which will have their own account in our system, will be the ones to set appointments for their patients depending on the hospital doctor’s timetable and also share the medical records of the patient with that doctor. After the specialist doctor finishes the appointments, updated patient records are sent back for download.

Each doctor will have his/her own account where he/she can add patients, set new appointments (this is done by polyclinic’s receptionists mainly/mostly), cancel them, write appointment notes which are added to patient records, check the medical records of a patient, check hospitalized patients’ progress. In addition the specialist doctor can send requests to the hospital receptionist to reserve a bed to hospitalize a patient, if he sees it necessary after an appointment. 

Also, in our system we will keep track of each doctor’s timetable and display how the shifts are going to be. Besides doctors, higher ups in administrate will have their own accounts, where they can make changes in timetables, shifts and in personnel such as adding/removing doctors, nurses and receptionists.  

Hospital receptionists will also have accounts but mostly of an observing nature, they won’t be able to make any changes but only check hospitalization information, inform on them during visiting hours but also add new entries for people who come for an emergency and reserve beds for patients who will be hospitalized.

Nurses will have their own accounts, where they see hospitalized patients in their ward and submit reports on their progress.
In addition, the project will consist of a separate part for the emergency section of the hospital to hold records of when the patient comes, his basic personal information, what were his symptoms. This information as we said will be added by the hospital receptionists and doctors on duty call.
