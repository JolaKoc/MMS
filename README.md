# MMS
Medical Management System

This is a Web-based Application that came out as an idea for all the people who have to wait in long queues just to be taken a maximum 5 minutes blood and urine samples.

Every patient can easily create his/her own account/profile in the MMS with their personal information and also if they would like to, they are able to write other previous or current medical conditions.

By having created their account, each patient can choose their doctor in order to have a consultation and set up an appointment at the time and dates available in the MMS.

If needed (if the doctor asked them) the patient can select the most convenient date and time for their tests/analysis to be taken.

As soon as the tests reports are ready, they will be available for both the patient and the doctor in the MMS. In this way, the doctor can write its own comments and give diagnosis and also prescriptions if needed.

Thus, it would be easier for both the doctor and the patient to keep track and be aware of medical history (anamnesis).

There will be also an online chat in order for the patients to communicate with the doctors in case they have any emergencies or questions.
