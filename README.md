Medical Management System

Taking into consideration the numerous problems in our country’s health department such as medical records being on paper and people waiting in long lines, we came up with the idea of creating a Web-based Application to digitalize the way the public hospitals in our country work. 

Our project will be based on these main points:
  •	Leaving appointments online
  •	Keeping medical records of each patient in digital form
  
The implementation of the idea will work closely with polyclinics by having access at their databases for patients they forward to us. Polyclinic’s doctors will be the one to leave appointments for their patients depending on the hospital doctor’s timetable and also share the medical records of the patient with that doctor. 

Each doctor will have his/her own account where he/she can add patients, leave appointments (this is done by polyclinic’s doctors), cancel them, write prescriptions, check the medical records of a patient and alter them if needed.
Receptionists’ accounts will be mostly of an observing nature, without any power to make changes except to add patients in cases of emergency.

Also, in our system we will keep track of each doctor’s timetable and display how the shifts are going to be. This will be done by specific people in the administrative part who will have their own accounts too.

In addition, the project will consist of a separate part of the emergency section of the hospital to hold records of when the patient comes, what was his problem and which doctor attended to his needs.
