# MMS
Medical Management System

Knowing about the numerous problems in our country's health department, we came up with the idea of building a management system for hospitals that will solve the problem of long lines when waiting for a visit and loss of data as consequence of it not being digital.

Our project consists of a Web-based Application with two main points:
1. A system for leaving appointments online
2. A system where every patient has its own medical history (anamnesis) stored in digital form

Every patient can easily create his/her own account/profile in the MMS with their personal information and also if they would like to, they are able to write other previous or current medical conditions.

By having created their account, each patient can choose their doctor in order to have a consultation and set up an appointment at the time and dates available in the MMS.

If needed (if the doctor asked them) the patient can select the most convenient date and time for their tests/analysis to be taken.

As soon as the tests reports are ready, they will be available for both the patient and the doctor in the MMS. In this way, the doctor can write its own comments and give diagnosis and also prescriptions if needed.

Thus, it would be easier for both the doctor and the patient to keep track and be aware of medical history (anamnesis).

There will be also an online chat in order for the patients to communicate with the doctors in case they have any emergencies or questions.
